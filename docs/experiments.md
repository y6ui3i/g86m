# Experiment ledger

A card is written before an experiment runs, and its result is added in the same place.

## E001: Can the core of an emulator be written in Goose? (M0, 2026-11-12)

- **Hypothesis**: With Goose v2026.4, the four shapes at the core of an x86 interpreter can be written
  without fighting the language.
  (a) A struct for the CPU state and 1 MB of guest RAM, both as globals
  (b) Opcode dispatch with `match`, at a usable speed
  (c) A round trip of the CPU state through `to_bytes` / `from_bytes` (the seed of snapshots)
  (d) Calling our own C through `extern fn` (glue for things like terminal raw mode)
- **What changed since last time**: First run. The inputs are rustx86's `asm/hello.bin` and
  `asm/bench.bin` (a 10-instruction loop with a fixed instruction count).
- **Next move for each result**:
  - hello prints `Hello, World!`, bench stops at HLT and runs at 100 MIPS or more → go on to M1
    (the full 8086 instruction set) written the same way
  - It works but below 30 MIPS → read the generated C, then change the bounds checks (`--bce-lines`)
    and where RAM lives, and measure again
  - (a) or (b) cannot be written under the language rules → move RAM to the C side and reassess.
    If that fails too, report it as grounds for dropping Goose
  - Only (c) or (d) cannot be written → carry on with M1, and record in an ADR that snapshots and
    glue live on the C side
- **Cut-off**: The same day. On anything that looks like a compiler bug, keep a minimal reproduction
  and move on with a workaround.

### Result

2026-11-12, Goose v2026.4 (macos-arm64 release), clang 21.0.0, Apple Silicon. All four passed.
**Next move: on to M1, written the same way.**

| Item | Result |
|---|---|
| (a) struct + 1 MB RAM | `var ram: u8[RAM_SIZE]` and `var cpu: Cpu` work as globals (`probe/m0.goose`) |
| (b) `match` dispatch | hello.bin prints `Hello, World!` and halts after 84 instructions. bench.bin halts after 369,095,178 instructions; three runs took 1857–1890 ms = **about 197 MIPS** |
| (b) correctness | At the end of bench, AX=57136 BX=13090 DX=4148 and the instruction count match a separately written Python model |
| (c) snapshot | `Cpu[>..]` (30 bytes) and 1 MB of RAM make the round trip through `to_bytes` → `from_bytes` and compare equal. Corrupting the first byte returns `false` and an empty array (`probe/m0_snap.goose`) |
| (d) C interop | `c_sources` in `m0_cext.build` links our own C; a scalar and a slice (`{data, len}`) cross the boundary (`probe/m0_cext.goose`) |

What was learned:

- A `--debug` build takes 21,248 ms on bench (about 17 MIPS). It adds signed-overflow and range
  checks, so tests use debug and measurements use release
- Serialization works on arrays. A single struct goes in a one-element `T[>..]`
- `args` and `write_stderr` need `import os;` (`std` alone does not provide them)
- An integer `match` takes half-open ranges (`0x40..0x48`), so opcodes with an embedded register
  number can be listed as they are
- The only thing typechecking made me fix was one import line. Nothing got stuck on the language rules

Not measured: ModR/M with memory operands, interrupts, devices. The 197 MIPS figure is for a
10-instruction loop, not for running an operating system.

## E002: Speed against the same fragment written in Rust (2026-11-12)

- **Hypothesis**: Rust code of the same shape as `probe/m0.goose` (`probe/m0.rs`: the same
  instructions, the same flag computation, the same 1 MB of RAM) is within ±20% of the Goose version
  on bench.bin.
- **What changed since last time**: The Goose version from E001 is unchanged. Two things are added
  to compare against: (1) the same fragment in Rust, and (2) rustx86's own `core/examples/bench.rs`,
  as a reference only, since it is the finished product with a decode cache, devices and interrupts.
- **Next move for each result**:
  - Within ±20% → stop worrying about the language's speed and go on to M1. Work on speed waits
    until the instruction set is complete
  - Goose is more than 20% slower → before M1, look at the remaining bounds checks with
    `--bce-lines` and decide how RAM access is written
  - Goose is more than 20% faster → check why once (the generated C and assembly), record it, and
    go on to M1
- **Cut-off**: The same day. Five runs each, compared by the median.

### Result

2026-11-12, Apple Silicon, bench.bin (369,095,178 instructions), median of five runs each.
**The hypothesis was wrong. The Goose version takes about 35% longer than Rust code of the same shape.**

| Implementation | Median | MIPS | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Rust fragment (`probe/m0.rs`, rustc 1.97.1 `-C opt-level=3`) | 1386 ms | about 266 | |
| Goose fragment (`probe/m0.goose`, v2026.4 → clang 21 `-O2`) | 1873 ms | about 197 | 1.35 times the Rust time |
| rustx86 itself (`core/examples/bench.rs`, release) | 7.07 s | about 52 | The finished product, with devices, interrupts and 32-bit support; a reference only |

All three execute 369,095,178 instructions. The two fragments also agree on AX / BX / DX at the end.

The cause was looked into once:

- **Not bounds checks.** `--bce-lines` shows 59 of 60 removed. The one that remains is on the AH side
  of `get8` (`regs[i - 4]`), which bench's inner loop never reaches
- **Not indirection through globals.** `GS_GL` in the generated C is the address of static storage;
  no pointer is reloaded
- **Hardly the C optimization level.** Recompiling the generated C at `-O3` gives 1765 ms (about 5% better)
- One candidate remains and is untested: a `u8` write to RAM may alias the CPU state, so clang may
  reload flags and registers after every write. Rust avoids this through the uniqueness of `Box`

Next move (the "more than 20% slower" branch of the card, updated with what was found):

- Bounds checks are not the cause, so the way RAM access is written stays. **M1 goes ahead as planned**
- Speed is measured again once the instruction set is complete, at the point lazy flags go in
  (keep only the result and the operands, compute a flag when it is read). That cuts the reads and
  writes in set_flag, so it should help at the same time if aliasing reloads are the cause
- Even as a fragment, Goose is about 3.8 times faster than rustx86 itself. rustx86 does much more,
  so this does not mean Goose is faster than Rust

## E003: Verify the 8086 instruction set by diffing traces against rustx86 (M1, 2026-11-12)

- **Hypothesis**: The 16-bit real-mode implementation in `src/` matches rustx86 on every line of the
  state at each instruction boundary (CS:IP, the eight general registers, ES/SS/DS, FLAGS), for eight
  test boot sectors, one per instruction group (`tests/asm/t_*.asm`), and four rustx86 boot sectors.
- **What changed since last time**: The fragment from E001 (25 instructions) grew into the 8086 + 186
  instruction set. The oracle is `trace16`, added to rustx86 (`tools/oracle/trace16.rs`). rustx86
  matches expected values from a real 386 bit for bit on test386.asm, so g86m follows rustx86 on
  undefined flags too.
- **Next move for each result**:
  - Every line matches → fix the expected traces in `tests/expected/`, open a PR, go on to M2 (ELKS)
  - A mismatch → find the instruction at the first line that differs and fix it. If it is an
    undefined flag, read rustx86's implementation and follow it
  - If rustx86 looks like it departs from the 8086 specification → do not follow it; record it and ask
- **Cut-off**: The same day. Instructions with no test (IN/OUT on real devices, the interrupt
  controller) move to M2.

### Result

2026-11-12. **Every line matched. Next move: fix the expected traces, open a PR, go on to M2.**

| Test | Lines | Contents |
|---|---:|---|
| t_alu / t_alu2 | 945 / 400 | The 8 operations and TEST, INC / DEC / NEG / NOT, in every operand form |
| t_shift | 2924 | 7 rotates and shifts × 14 counts × 8 and 16 bits |
| t_muldiv | 650 | MUL / IMUL / DIV / IDIV, divide errors, CBW / CWD / AAM / AAD |
| t_bcd | 4533 | DAA / DAS / AAA / AAS × 52 values of AL × 4 combinations of CF and AF |
| t_string | 96 | MOVS / CMPS / SCAS / STOS / LODS, each REP form, both directions of DF, segment overrides |
| t_flow | 538 | 16 conditions × 14 flag words, the LOOP family, CALL / RET / far forms, INT / INTO / IRET |
| t_misc | 147 | 24 ModR/M forms, default and overridden segments, the stack, PUSHA / ENTER, XCHG / XLAT, flag instructions |
| hello / interrupt / vram | 98 / 37 / 44 | rustx86's boot sectors |
| s_selfcheck | - | Self-check for the two cases the oracle cannot judge (IDIV of the minimum value, SALC) |

Of the four rustx86 boot sectors the hypothesis named, three were compared. The fourth, `mode13.bin`,
needs devices and is listed under "Left out of M1" below.

Debug and release builds give the same result. `tools/difftest.sh` reproduces it; the expected traces
are fixed in `tests/expected/`, so rustx86 is not needed.

On the first run, 7 of the 11 matched. The causes of the other 4:

| Mismatch | Cause | Fixed in |
|---|---|---|
| OF after right rotates and shifts | A real 386 leaves OF alone unless the count is 1 (only left rotates update it at every count). g86m updated it every time | g86m |
| The top 4 bits pushed by PUSHF | rustx86 defaults to its 8086 profile, which pushes them as ones. g86m pushed zeros | g86m |
| The high word of 16-bit `MUL` was 0 | A Goose compiler bug ([goose-notes.md](goose-notes.md), item 1) | g86m (workaround) |
| The sign of the IDIV remainder | Goose's `%` floors ([goose-notes.md](goose-notes.md), item 2) | g86m |

The tests had three bugs of their own: NASM emitted the 386 near Jcc; a table was read with DF set,
so the read ran backwards; and a caller of RET n did not push the arguments. The backwards read was
an endless loop, and a trace with no cut-off grew to 60 GB. It was deleted at once, and `difftest.sh`
now stops at 2 million instructions.

What turned up in rustx86 and was not followed is at the end of [goose-notes.md](goose-notes.md).

Speed: bench.bin takes 3394–3487 ms on the release build = **about 108 MIPS**. It is slower than the
E001 fragment (197 MIPS) because prefix handling and the general form of ModR/M are now in. It is
about twice rustx86 itself (about 52 MIPS).

Left out of M1:

- `mode13.bin`: it needs the INT 10h mode set and the VGA DAC ports. Devices start in M2
- IN / OUT on real devices, the PIC and PIT, hardware interrupts
- The 66h / 67h prefixes and instructions that start with 0Fh (386 and later). g86m stops on them
- Checking what is in VRAM. For vram.bin only the register trace is compared

## E004: Boot ELKS to a shell (M2, 2026-11-12)

- **Hypothesis**: With a PIC, a PIT, an 8042 keyboard controller, BIOS disk services (INT 13h) and
  hardware interrupt delivery added to the M1 core, ELKS 0.9.1 (`fd2880.img`, the image rustx86
  boots) reaches `login:`, accepts `root` typed through the keyboard controller, and runs a command
  at the shell prompt.
- **What changed since last time**: M1 ran boot sectors with interrupts disabled and no devices. This
  adds devices, a virtual clock (the PIT advances one tick per 4 instructions), interrupt delivery
  between instructions, and a headless script (`--wait TEXT` / `--type TEXT`) that drives the
  keyboard and reads the text screen at B8000h.
- **Next move for each result**:
  - Reaches the shell and `uname -a` prints an ELKS line → fix the script as a regression test,
    open a PR, then add an interactive terminal front end
  - Stops on an unimplemented BIOS call, port or opcode → implement it and run again (the machine
    stops rather than guessing, so each stop names what is missing)
  - Runs without stopping but never reaches `login:` → compare the trace with rustx86's from the
    start of the disk boot, find the first line that differs that is not an interrupt arriving at a
    different time, and fix that instruction
  - The screen and rustx86's agree up to a point and then the kernel hangs waiting → suspect the
    clock or the interrupt controller, not the CPU: check that IRQ0 is delivered and acknowledged
- **Cut-off**: The same day. If the kernel boots but the keyboard path does not work by then, record
  how far it got and open the PR with `login:` as the reached point.

### Result

2026-11-12. **ELKS reaches the shell and runs commands. Next move: open a PR, then an interactive
terminal front end.**

The script waits for `login:`, types `root`, waits for the `# ` prompt, runs `uname -a` and then
`ls /bin | head -3; echo done-$?`. The screen at the end:

```
[0.69 secs] login: root
# uname -a
ELKS elks 0.9.1 commit d9ca2128 05 May 2026 15:34:43 -0700 ibmpc i8086
# ls /bin | head -3; echo done-$?
advent
arp
banner
done-0
#
```

- It passes on both the debug and the release build, and is now part of `tools/difftest.sh`
  (skipped, and reported as skipped, when `images/fd2880.img` is absent)
- The whole script takes about 0.1 s of real time on the release build
- The M1 trace tests still match on every line after the device work
- bench.bin: 3468–3577 ms, about 105 MIPS (about 108 before). The per-instruction timer countdown
  and the interrupt check cost about 3%

ELKS reached `login:` on the first run of the new code: the machine did not stop on an unimplemented
BIOS call, port or opcode. So the "implement what it stops on" branch of the card was never taken,
and the trace comparison against rustx86 for the disk boot was not needed and not done.

What that leaves untested, since ELKS did not exercise it or nothing checks it:

- The BIOS keyboard path (INT 16h, the INT 09h handler). ELKS installs its own keyboard handler
- INT 10h scrolling and character writes other than teletype output
- Disk writes (INT 13h AH=03h) reach the in-memory image only; nothing is written back to the file
- The clock. One timer tick per 4 instructions is a made-up ratio, and idle time is skipped, so
  nothing here says whether time passes at a believable rate for a person at the keyboard

Known wrong:

- The date ELKS prints is `Thu Oct 17 09:47:13 1991`. There is no CMOS clock, so ports 70h/71h read
  as FFh and ELKS decodes that
- `ktcp` fails to open `/dev/ne0`: the image has networking enabled and there is no NE2000. Expected

Ports ELKS used that nothing answers (from `--ports`): 70h/71h (CMOS), 80h (POST delay), 2E9h/2F9h/
3E9h/3F9h (serial probes), 240h–24Fh and 300h–31Ch and 330h (network and ATA probes), 3F2h (floppy
controller), 110h, 510h/511h.

Not done in M2: an interactive front end. The only way to use the shell so far is the script.

## E005: An interactive terminal console (2026-11-12)

- **Hypothesis**: A console that draws the 80x25 text screen in the host terminal with ANSI escapes,
  feeds host keystrokes to the keyboard controller as scancodes, and paces the virtual clock against
  real time, is enough to use the ELKS shell by hand: what is typed appears, commands run, and
  `sleep 3` takes about 3 seconds.
- **What changed since last time**: E004 drove the machine with a script and skipped idle time. This
  adds C glue for raw terminal mode (`src/console.c`), a renderer that sends only the cells that
  changed, key translation (printable keys, Enter, Backspace, Ctrl combinations, arrows and the
  editing keys), and pacing: the machine runs one hundredth of a second of virtual time, then sleeps
  until real time catches up. The virtual CPU speed stays at 4 instructions per timer tick, about
  4.77 million instructions per second.
- **Next move for each result**:
  - A pseudo-terminal test logs in, runs a command, sees `sleep 3` take 2.5–3.5 s, and quits with
    the terminal restored → open a PR and hand it over to be tried by hand
  - Text is garbled or keys are lost → dump the bytes the console writes and reads in the test and
    fix the renderer or the key translation
  - `sleep 3` is far from 3 s → the pacing or the timer model is wrong; measure virtual against
    real time over the same interval before changing the ratio
  - The terminal is left in raw mode after quitting or a crash → fix the restore path before
    anything else, since that breaks the user's shell
- **Cut-off**: The same day. FreeDOS is out of scope here: it needs M3.

### Result

2026-11-12. **The console works through a pseudo-terminal. Next move: open a PR and hand it over to
be tried by hand.**

`tools/console_test.py` starts g86m on a pseudo-terminal, keeps its own 80x25 grid from the escape
sequences g86m writes, and types as a person would:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Boots to `login:` | 0.7 s of real time, the same figure ELKS prints as `[0.69 secs]` |
| Logs in as root, runs `uname -a` | `ibmpc i8086` on the screen, then the prompt |
| `sleep 3; echo slept` | 3.04 s of real time (accepted range 2.5–3.5 s) |
| Backspace | Seven Backspaces erase `wrongXX`, and the line that runs prints `backsp` |
| Ctrl-C | `sleep 30` is still running after 1 s; Ctrl-C brings the prompt back in 0.02 s |
| Ctrl-] | g86m exits with status 0, leaves the alternate screen, and the terminal modes are back to what they were |

It is part of `tools/difftest.sh` when the image and python3 are there. The M1 trace tests and the
ELKS script still pass on both builds. bench.bin is unchanged at about 105 MIPS.

Two things went wrong on the way, both in the test and not in the console:

- The first version stripped escape sequences and searched the remaining text. The console sends
  only the cells that changed, so blanks that were already on the screen are never sent, and `# `
  could not match. The test now applies cursor moves to a grid of its own
- The first Ctrl-C check passed in 0.00 s: it looked at the grid before reading any new output and
  saw the old prompt. It now waits until `sleep 30` has been running for a second before sending
  Ctrl-C

Not checked, because a pseudo-terminal test cannot see it:

- How it looks: colours, the cursor, the code page 437 line-drawing characters. ELKS at a shell
  prompt uses none of the last
- A host terminal smaller than 80x25. Nothing handles it; lines will wrap (this was the first
  thing to go wrong by hand; see the follow-up below)
- Arrow keys, function keys and the editing keys. The translation is written but no test presses them
- How it feels to type. The guest runs at about 4.77 million instructions per second, a made-up
  figure that follows from 4 instructions per timer tick

### Follow-up: first try by hand (2026-11-12)

The first session by hand looked broken: prompts repeated down the screen, and the output of `ls`
appeared as one line with a `#` written over its start. The pasted screen had 10 lines.

- **Cause, as far as the evidence goes**: the terminal was shorter than 25 rows. The console
  addressed rows up to 25, a terminal clamps a row past its last line to the last line, and so the
  lower rows of the guest's screen were all drawn on top of each other there. This is the case the
  result above listed as not handled. It is inferred from the 10-line paste and from the fix
  curing a 10-row pseudo-terminal; the terminal's size at the time was not measured
- **Fix**: the console reads the terminal's size on every redraw and draws only the part of the
  80x25 screen that fits. Down the screen the view follows the guest's cursor and otherwise stays
  put; sideways it returns to column 0 whenever the cursor fits. A change of size or view clears
  and redraws
- **Test**: `tools/console_test.py` now also scrolls the guest's screen with `ls /bin`, fails if
  the console ever addresses a cell outside the terminal, and repeats the session on an 80x10 and
  a 60x12 terminal. All three sizes pass

The 60x12 run failed once before it passed: after a line longer than the view, the view stayed
shifted right and hid the `# ` prompt. That is why the sideways rule differs from the vertical one.

Still not checked on a real terminal: colours, the cursor, line-drawing characters, arrow and
function keys, and resizing the window while it runs.

### Follow-up: no way out (2026-11-12)

The second try by hand ended with "I don't know how to get out". The quit key, Ctrl-], was
mentioned in the README and nowhere on the screen.

- The way out is now shown in three places: a line printed before the console opens (held for 1.2 s
  when the terminal has no spare row, and left in the scrollback), the window title, and a dim line
  below the screen when the terminal has more than 25 rows
- Two more keys leave the console: F12 and Ctrl-\. Ctrl-] is awkward on some keyboard layouts
- The test checks the line before the console opens, the line below the screen at 100x30, and
  leaves by a different key in each of its three sessions

Adding the line below the screen turned up a bug in the previous follow-up: the first redraw did
not clear and set up the terminal unless the view differed from the default, so on a terminal of
25 rows or more nothing was cleared at the start. The first redraw now always does.

Whether Ctrl-] itself failed to reach g86m in that terminal, or was simply not known, is not
established.
